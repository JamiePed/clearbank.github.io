## Multi-currency transactions

Multi-currency transaction endpoints allow you to retrieve:
- A list of transactions for a multi-currency account and any virtual accounts associated with it
- A multi-currency virtual account
- A single transaction

You can also access [Multi-currency statements](#multi-currency-statements).

<EndpointBlock
  type="get"
  title="Retrieve a list of transactions for an account and virtual accounts associated with the account"
  endpoints={[
    {
      path: "/mccy/v1/Accounts/{accountId}/transactions",
      version: "1.0.MCCY-Transactions",
    }
  ]}
/>

<EndpointBlock

  endpoints={[
    {
      path: "/mccy/v1/VirtualAccounts/{virtualAccountId}/transactions",

## Multi-currency statements

Your multi-currency bank statement is an official summary of financial transactions that have occurred for all multi-currency accounts within a calendar month.

Statements can be generated either for all accounts associated with your institution, or for a specific real account associated with your institution. The statement will be provided via a webhook (see [Use webhooks](../api/getting-started/#use-webhooks)).

<EndpointBlock
  type="post"
  title="Request a statement for all accounts associated with your institution"
  endpoints={[
    {
      path: "/mccy/v1/StatementRequests",
      version: "1.0.MCCY-Statements",
      webhooks: [
        'mccy-institution-statement-webhook-v1'
      ]
    }
  ]}
/>

<EndpointBlock
  type="post"
  title="Request a statement for a specific account associated with your institution"
  endpoints={[
    {
      path: "/mccy/v1/StatementRequests/account/{iban}",
      version: "1.0.MCCY-Statements",
      webhooks: [
        'mccy-account-statement-webhook-v1'
      ]
    }
  ]}
/>
